Slice-Dice-Exam2013
===================

This is a project, that I had to build in a single exam session that lasted 8 hours and took place at the Telerik Academy Sofia, Bulgaria.  The project was uploaded minutes after the end of the exam and will not be altered or upgraded any further.  Used tools:  Visual Studio 2012 Adobe Photoshop 5.1 Google Chrome current version Internet Explorer 10 working in IE7 simulation mode  The exam task is a .psd file, that is included in the upload.  Task:  Slice the .psd and create a web page out of it.
